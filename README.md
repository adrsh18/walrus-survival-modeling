# Bayesian Networks to study the factors affecting the population of Pacific Walrus
This is an attempt to explain the impact of environmental and anthropogenic factors on the decreasing population of Pacific Walrus. Factors have been modelled using Bayesian Networks and probabilistic inference techniques.

* **report.pdf** 		-- Report for this project.
* **main-libpgm.ipynb** 	-- Main code that implements Bayesian Network and performs using libpgm.
* **optional-pgmpy.ipynb**	-- Old implementation of the project in pgmpy. Comparison of fit between libpgm and pgmpy has been detailed in Section 3 of Report.
* **json-builder.ipynb**	-- libpgm requires node and edge information of Bayesian Network be given in JSON format. This script generates that JSON file.
* **network.json**		-- JSON file generated by json-builder.ipynb
* **walrus.xdsl**		-- XML file for Bayesian Network and CPDs constructed from the original paper.
